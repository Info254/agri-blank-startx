Potato prices currently fluctuate between KES 800 and KES 3,500 per 110kg bag, with forecast confidence of ${forecastConfidence}. Price volatility in Nyandarua is particularly high, with:
- Price drops of up to 60% within a month during peak harvest (Source: Nyandarua County Potato Value Chain Analysis 2023)
- 85% of farmers selling within two weeks of harvest due to limited storage (Source: Kenya Potato Council Market Survey 2023)
- Annual income variability coefficient of 70% (Source: National Potato Task Force Report 2023)

Recent implementation of community storage facilities in six locations has helped 1,200 farmers reduce exposure to price volatility, increasing average income by 40% (Source: Nyandarua Potato Storage Pilot Project Report, Q1 2023).

For tomorrow's sales, waiting 2-3 months could potentially yield 30% higher returns based on historical patterns, though this requires proper storage facilities.

Several buyers from Nairobi and local markets are actively looking for potatoes in Nyandarua. Would you like me to help connect you with potential buyers or suggest storage solutions for this market?

Expected production is ${bestForecast.expectedProduction} ${unit} against an expected demand of ${bestForecast.expectedDemand} ${unit}.

For tomorrow's sales, I recommend targeting markets in ${countyText} as prices are projected to increase by approximately 3-5% based on current demand trends.
